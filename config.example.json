    "The article's primary purpose is sharing real experience or insight, not marketing a product, announcing a launch, or promoting a company's tool or platform. Genuine personal reflections are acceptable even if they mention their company, but the article should not read as promotional content.",
    "It is a first-hand account from an individual person or small team reflecting on their genuine experience, not a corporate blog showcasing an internal tool or platform capability.",
    "The article describes one or more instances of the author using AI coding agents for substantial implementation of their own work. Meta-commentary or industry analysis about AI/LLMs does not satisfy this.",
    "The author provides specific quantitative terms or reasoned estimates describing their own productivity gains from AI coding tools (e.g., time savings, cost savings, before/after comparisons, percentage of code written by AI, ratio of active involvement to total time, scope of work accomplished in a stated timeframe, etc.). General industry statistics, adoption figures, or market data do not count. Vague or impressionistic multipliers (e.g., 10x) also do not qualify."
